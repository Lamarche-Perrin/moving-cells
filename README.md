# Moving Cells

Moving Cells is a digital installation building on a depth sensor to allow spectators to interact with a cloud of particles through their movements. It has been developed and first displayed in June 2015 by Robin Lamarche-Perrin and Bruno Pace for the [eponymous dance festival](http://www.movingcells.org), in Leipzig.

The current version of the program is implemented on Kinect for Windows v2 (K4W2) through the open source driver [libreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2). Note that this sensor also requires a USB 3.0 controller.

## Installation on Linux
* Install [libreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2).
* Install OpenCV:
```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

* Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lamarche-Perrin/moving-cells
```

* Compile the files:
```
cd moving_cells
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Note that you might need to adjust `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` in `CMakeLists.txt` to fit with the install location of the freenect2 library, that is something like `path/to/freenect2/lib/cmake/freenect2`.

* Run the programs:
```
./bin/moving-cells
./bin/time-delays
./bin/time-ghosts
```

## Time Delays

Run the program with
```
./bin/time-delays <input>
```
where `<input>` is an optional parameter that is either
* the camera id you want to stream from (list devices with `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` once `v4l-utils` is installed)
* or the path to a video file you want to stream from.

If not specified, the application will try to open the webcam with id `0`.


### Control during execution

* `<Space>` to switch black screen on (or off)
* `<Escape>` to close the application
<br/><br/>

* `0` to suppress delay
* from `1` to `9` to set delay (from 15 frames to 135 frames, that is from 0.5 to 4.5 seconds in the case of 30fps)
* `+` to increase delay by 1
* `-` to decrease delay by 1
<br/><br/>

* `<Enter>` to switch heterogeneous delay on (or off)
* `h` to switch to horizontal delay
* `v` to switch to vertical delay
* `r` to reverse the direction of delay
* `s` to activate or deactivate symmetric delay
