 * Moving Cells is is a digital installation building on a depth sensor to
 * allow spectators to interact with a cloud of particles through their movements.
 * It has been developed and first displayed in June 2015 by Robin Lamarche-Perrin
 * and Bruno Pace for the eponymous dance festival, in Leipzig.
 * See: http://www.movingcells.org
 * 
 * The current version of the program is implemented on Kinect for Windows v2 (K4W2)
 * through the open source driver libreenect2.
